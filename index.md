###VacStance – Detecting Stance in a Polarized Media Environment: 
The Covid-19 Vaccine Case in the United States

We examine U.S. news media coverage on Covid-19 vaccine topic as an illustration of a debate in a polarized environment through the stance in the media on vaccine safety. Specifically, we analyze opinion-framing in the Covid-19 vaccine debate as a way of attributing a statement or belief to someone else. We focus on self-affirming and opponent-doubting discourse and analyze if Left-leaning and Right-leaning media engage in self-affirming or opponent-doubting discourse. For example, a health expert would say that “The leading researchers agree that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective” while a vaccine skeptic would say that “Mistaken researchers claim that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective”.
